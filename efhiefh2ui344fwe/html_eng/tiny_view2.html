                  On 9th, LG U+ announced that LG will perform reorganization focusing on content production, professional recruitment, and continuing to expand investment in partner companies to strengthen competitiveness in media services. It is part of the U+3.0 strategy to strengthen media competitiveness and speed up transition to a platform company through different original content.<br><br>

                  First of all, LG U+ reorganized CCO(Chief Content Officer) organization this month to start creating original content in earnestness from next year. With STUDIO X+U, an organization specializing in content production within the CCO organization, a content production center dedicated to content production will be established under its wing to support members’ free creative activities.<br><br>
                  
                  STUDIO X+U has been reorganized into two organizations: “Content IP Business Manager”, in charge of discovering, developing and investing content IP, and “Content Creation Center” in charge of content creation. Director, Lee Sang Jin, who joined CJ ENM and Hive, will be in charge of the Content IP Business, while producer, Shin Jung Soo, who joined LG U+ in late October, will be in charge of content creation and planning.<br><br>
                  
                  The Content CreationCenter, which is the core of the original content creation, will be operated by four teams: Variety Production Team 1 ▲ Variety Production Team 2 ▲ Variety Special Team ▲ Music Content Creation Team. The first and second teams of variety production will be led by producer Lee Geun Chan, who directed programs such as tvN’s “Sexy Brain Era - Problematic Man” and “Hwaseong In Virus,” who joined LG U+ this year, and producer Lim Hyung Taek, who presented SBS’s “Running Man” and “Family Outing,” respectively, to produce new concept variety contents.<br><br>
                  
                  The Variety Special Team, which is in charge of producing reality and factual entertainment content, will be headed by producer Yang Ja Young joining LG U+ earlier this month. Producer Yang Ja Young joined KBS in 2004 and is a content expert who presented popular programs such as “Happy Sunday” and “Hello to the National Talk Show.”<br><br>
                  
                  In addition, producer Park Sang Joon, who has created music contents such as Mnet’s Voice Korea 2020 and I Can See Your Voice in China, will be the team leader to plan and create music-based contents and idol-related contents.<br><br>
                  
                  LG U+ plans to continue recruiting content experts as it has formed an organization centered on content creation. Contents created by professionals will be introduced through “Play platforms” such as U+ Mobile TV, a mobile service, and U+tv, an IPTV service.<br><br>
                  
                  Along with content creation, LG U+ is also actively investing in securing competitive content IP. On 8th, LG U+ participated in the Fencher K-Content Investment Association, a fund in charge of investing in video content projects, and invested its stake in BIGC, a startup that provides a platform that connects content creators and fans.<br><br>
                  
                  The Fencher K-Content Investment Association, which participated with LG Electronics, Kakao Entertainment, Barunson E&A, Barunson and Shinhan Financial Group, is expected to play a role in leading a virtuous cycle in the domestic content market by discovering competitive domestic and foreign content and jointly possessing IPs with creators. BIGC, invested by LG U+, plans to operate BIGC Studio, a platform for creators and a live community for fans and readers, contributing to the formation of a virtuous cycle of the market through content IP-based monetization.<br><br>
                  
                  In the future, LG U+ plans to expand cooperation with various partners to secure IP, which is the basis for content competitiveness. Earlier, LG U+ secured content IP by investing its stake in competitive content creators such as SAMG, the producer of the animation Catch Tinniping, Dream Factory, which created the animation Jellygo, and Meta Theater, which has a number of musical-related IPs.<br><br>
                  
                  “We will provide different pleasure and experience to customers by creating new contents. We will grow ‘play platform’, one of the four platforms proposed by LG U+ as a future business, and bring the best customer satisfaction.” Lee Deok Jae, CCO of LG U+ said.
